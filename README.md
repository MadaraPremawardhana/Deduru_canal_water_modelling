# Deduru_canal_water_modelling
Sri Lankan's deduru reservoir's catchment area faces extreme conditions such as draughts and floods due to mismanagement of water from the canals, which is a result of weak prediction models. This project proposes using LSTM for predicting water levels of the reservoir for better canal flow prediction.
